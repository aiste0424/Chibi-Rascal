==================================================
The score counter works like this:

While the reaper is stunned, your souls will be taken from you when
collecting them. For example, I stunned the Grim Reaper 3 times and
collected 5 souls while he was stunned, 3*5=15 souls will be taken away from me.
Colliding with the reaper and not hitting it will increase the stun counter,
so it's best to not collide with it.
